# 10 Vacuum Sealing Mistakes That Are Ruining Your Food

Even with the best vacuum sealer, simple mistakes can compromise your food's quality and safety. Here are the most common errors people make and how to avoid them.

## 1. Not Pre-Freezing Liquids and Soft Foods

**The Mistake**: Trying to vacuum seal soups, sauces, or soft fruits directly.

**Why It's Bad**: Liquids get sucked into the machine, and soft foods get crushed.

**The Fix**: Pre-freeze liquids for 2-4 hours until solid, then vacuum seal. For soft foods, use the pulse vacuum setting.

## 2. Overpacking Bags

**The Mistake**: Cramming too much food into one bag.

**Why It's Bad**: Prevents proper air removal and can cause seal failure.

**The Fix**: Leave 3-4 inches of space at the top and don't overfill bags.

## 3. Sealing Wet or Dirty Bags

**The Mistake**: Not cleaning the bag opening before sealing.

**Why It's Bad**: Moisture and food particles prevent proper sealing.

**The Fix**: Always wipe the bag opening clean and dry before sealing.

## 4. Using the Wrong Bag Type

**The Mistake**: Using regular plastic bags or smooth vacuum bags.

**Why It's Bad**: Poor air removal and weak seals.

**The Fix**: Use textured, food-grade vacuum sealer bags designed for your machine.

## 5. Ignoring Food Safety Guidelines

**The Mistake**: Vacuum sealing foods that shouldn't be sealed or storing at wrong temperatures.

**Why It's Bad**: Can create dangerous bacterial growth, especially botulism.

**The Fix**: Research which foods are safe to vacuum seal and follow proper storage temperatures.

## 6. Not Blanching Vegetables

**The Mistake**: Vacuum sealing raw vegetables without blanching.

**Why It's Bad**: Enzymes continue to work, causing color and texture changes.

**The Fix**: Blanch vegetables in boiling water for 1-3 minutes, then ice bath before sealing.

## 7. Sealing Sharp Objects Without Protection

**The Mistake**: Vacuum sealing bones, shells, or sharp items directly.

**Why It's Bad**: Punctures bags and causes seal failure.

**The Fix**: Wrap sharp items in paper towels or use double-bagging.

## 8. Poor Labeling Practices

**The Mistake**: Not labeling sealed packages with contents and date.

**Why It's Bad**: Leads to mystery packages and food waste.

**The Fix**: Always label with contents, date sealed, and use-by date.

## 9. Incorrect Storage Temperatures

**The Mistake**: Storing vacuum-sealed food at wrong temperatures.

**Why It's Bad**: Reduces shelf life and can create food safety issues.

**The Fix**: Follow proper storage guidelines - freezer for long-term, refrigerator for short-term.

## 10. Not Maintaining Your Vacuum Sealer

**The Mistake**: Never cleaning or maintaining the vacuum sealer.

**Why It's Bad**: Reduces performance and can contaminate food.

**The Fix**: Clean after each use, replace sealing strips when worn, and follow manufacturer maintenance schedule.

## Quick Reference: Do's and Don'ts
