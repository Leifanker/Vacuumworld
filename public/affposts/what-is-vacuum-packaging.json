  "faq": [
    {"q": "What foods shouldn't be vacuum sealed?", "a": "Avoid soft cheeses like brie, raw mushrooms, and garlic in oil. These can develop harmful bacteria in oxygen-free environments. When unsure, refrigerate and consume quickly."},
    {"q": "Do I need special bags?", "a": "External sealers require embossed (textured) bags for proper air removal. Chamber sealers use smooth bags that cost less per unit."},
    {"q": "Is vacuum sealing safe for sous vide?", "a": "Yes, when done properly. Use food-safe bags rated for cooking temperatures and follow time/temperature guidelines for food safety."},
    {"q": "Can I reuse vacuum bags?", "a": "You can reuse bags that stored dry goods after washing. Never reuse bags that contained raw meat, fish, or dairy products."},
    {"q": "How long does vacuum sealed food last?", "a": "It varies by food type, but generally 3-5 times longer than traditional storage. Always check for signs of spoilage before consuming."},
    {"q": "Why does my vacuum sealer keep stopping?", "a": "Most sealers have automatic shut-off to prevent overheating. Let it cool for 15-20 seconds between seals, especially during heavy use."}
