      "problem": "Moisture or grease on the bag's sealing edge prevents proper heat sealing, causing weak spots that leak air.",
      "solution": "Always pat the sealing area dry with a paper towel before sealing. For greasy foods, fold the bag edge over to create a clean sealing surface.",
      "pro_tip": "Keep a roll of paper towels next to your sealer—you'll use them constantly."

      "problem": "Using 'Dry' mode on moist foods or 'Moist' mode on dry foods leads to over-vacuuming or weak seals.",
      "solution": "Use 'Moist' or 'Gentle' mode for juicy meats, soft fruits, and anything with liquid. Use 'Dry' mode for hard items like nuts, crackers, or pre-frozen foods.",
      "pro_tip": "When in doubt, start with gentle/pulse mode—you can always vacuum more, but you can't un-crush delicate foods."

      "h2": "Mistake #3: Overpacking the Bag",
      "problem": "Cramming too much food into one bag prevents proper air removal and creates stress points that can tear.",
      "solution": "Leave 3-4 inches of space at the top and don't pack bags more than 2/3 full. Use multiple smaller bags instead of one overstuffed bag.",
      "pro_tip": "Flat, single-layer packs vacuum better and stack more efficiently in your freezer."

      "problem": "Liquid gets sucked into the vacuum chamber, contaminating the machine and preventing proper sealing.",
      "solution": "Pre-freeze soups, stews, and marinades for 30-60 minutes until slushy, or use a chamber sealer designed for liquids.",
      "pro_tip": "Tilt your external sealer so the vacuum port is higher than the bag opening when sealing liquids."

      "problem": "Punctured bags, smooth bags in external sealers, or bags not rated for freezing cause seal failures.",
      "solution": "Always inspect bags for holes before use. Use embossed/textured bags with external sealers, smooth bags with chamber sealers. Choose freezer-grade bags for long-term storage.",
      "pro_tip": "Buy bags in bulk from generic suppliers—they're often 50% cheaper than brand-name bags with identical performance."

      "problem": "Bones, shells, and sharp edges puncture bags during vacuuming or storage, causing air leaks.",
      "solution": "Wrap sharp edges in paper towels or parchment paper before bagging. Consider removing bones or using thicker bags for bone-in cuts.",
      "pro_tip": "Double-bag items with sharp edges, or use a rigid container with vacuum attachment instead."

    {
      "q": "Why do my vacuum seals keep failing?",

    {
      "q": "Can I reuse vacuum bags?",
      "a": "You can reuse bags that stored dry goods after washing, but never reuse bags that contained raw meat, fish, or dairy products due to food safety concerns."

    {
      "q": "How long should vacuum sealed food last?",
      "a": "Properly vacuum sealed food lasts 3-5 times longer than traditional storage. Frozen meats can last 2-3 years, while refrigerated items typically last 1-2 weeks."
    },
    {
      "q": "What's the difference between pulse and continuous vacuum?",
      "a": "Pulse mode gives you control over vacuum strength, perfect for delicate foods. Continuous mode provides maximum vacuum for long-term storage of sturdy items."
